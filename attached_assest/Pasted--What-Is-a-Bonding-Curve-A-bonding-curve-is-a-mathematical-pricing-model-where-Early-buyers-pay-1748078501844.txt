🧠 What Is a Bonding Curve?
A bonding curve is a mathematical pricing model where:

Early buyers pay less.

Price increases as more tokens are minted/bought.

Common formula: Price = base_price + slope * supply

🛠️ Step 1: Define Your Curve Logic
Basic Linear Bonding Curve:

ts
Copy
Edit
function getPrice(supply: number): number {
  const basePrice = 0.01; // starting price in SOL
  const slope = 0.001;    // price increase per token
  return basePrice + slope * supply;
}
🧮 Step 2: Track Supply
You need to store how many tokens have been sold/minted.

Options:

Use a smart contract (recommended).

Or store in a backend database if off-chain.

🔁 Step 3: Create a Token Minting Endpoint
When a user wants to buy, your backend should:

Get current supply.

Calculate price with bonding curve.

Create a Solana transaction where user sends that amount of SOL to a treasury wallet.

Mint tokens to the buyer based on price.

Example (Node.js / Express):

ts
Copy
Edit
app.post("/mint", async (req, res) => {
  const buyer = req.body.wallet;
  const supply = await getCurrentSupply(); // from on-chain or database
  const price = getPrice(supply);
  
  // Create transaction that sends SOL to your treasury
  const transaction = await createPurchaseTransaction(buyer, price);

  res.json({
    success: true,
    price,
    transactionBuffer: transaction.serialize({ requireAllSignatures: false }).toString("base64")
  });
});
🔐 Step 4: Client Signs and Submits the Transaction
On your frontend (e.g., Vite + Phantom Wallet):

ts
Copy
Edit
const tx = Transaction.from(Buffer.from(txBuffer, 'base64'));
const signed = await wallet.signTransaction(tx);
const sig = await connection.sendRawTransaction(signed.serialize());
await connection.confirmTransaction(sig);
🔗 Step 5: Update Supply
After successful purchase, either:

Update your backend DB (supply += amount), or

Read from your token mint’s supply using getMint.

🧪 Bonus: Make It Like letsbonk.fun
UI: Show live price updates based on the bonding curve.

Animated Meter: Show % sold and current price dynamically.

Countdown/Presale Timer: Add a start time and display it.

Public Mint Button: Enable buying directly with Phantom/Backpack.

🧰 Tools You'll Likely Use
Helius or QuickNode for Solana RPC.

Metaplex or @solana/spl-token for token operations.

Backend: Node.js (Express), Firebase, or Supabase.

⚠️ Important Considerations
Make sure the mint and treasury wallets are secure.

Add limits (e.g., max buy per wallet).

Bonding curve math must be predictable and visible to users.

Confirm Solana transactions fully before minting.

Want Example Code?
Let me know:

Do you want it fully on-chain using a smart contract?

Or hybrid (backend + token minting)?

Do you already have a frontend built?
